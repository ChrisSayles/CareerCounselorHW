This is a Jr. FrontEnd Developer Role.  This role would let me utilize the skills I learned and bootcamp.  The FrontEnd aspect is intriguing to me because it will let me be creative.

This is another FrontEnd job that focuses on HTML,CSS, and JS.  I feel that I am becoming efficent with the 3 areas that this role pertains to.  I will be even more efficent at the end of our class session.
